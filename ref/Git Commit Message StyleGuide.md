## About
This is an attempt to standardize the format of commit messages, for the sake of **uniformity** in git log, **best practices** for writing commit messages & **fun**!

Using emojis at the beginning of commit messages, other than being fun, provides a simple way to indicate the intention of that commit, an ease for the eyes when browsing/reviewing git log. It's also a simple measure of the fact that how much that commit is focused on a single purpose, which is a good practice.

If these rules and/or using emojis is an [overkill](/../../issues/21) for your productivity or simply losing its purposes, please tailor them to your needs or don't use them.

### Summary of the reasons for these conventions:
- Fun!
- Simple navigation through git history (e.g. ignoring style changes).
- Automatic generating of the changelog.


## Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Message Subject(first line)
- Capitalize the `<subject>`.
- Do not end the first line with a period.
- Total characters of the first line **MUST** be _Less_ than or _Equal_ to **50** characters Long.
- Use the **present tense** ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the **imperative mood** ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Use `<type>` to identify what type of changes introduced in this commit; Allowed `<type>` keywords:
  - An Emoji(see below for [list of Suggested Emojis](#suggested-emojis))
  - Or a Text:
    - feat: new feature for the user(or :sparkles: emoji)
    - fix: bug fix for the user(or :ambulance: emoji)
    - docs: changes to the documentation(or :books: emoji)
    - style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change(or :art: emoji)
    - refactor: refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable(or :tractor: emoji)
    - test: adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change(or :microscope: emoji)
    - chore: updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change
- If you need more than one keyword or emoji to use, you should probably think twice!. This usally means you need to break this commit into more smaller commits; If thats not the case then separate each emoji with a space.
- Use `<scope>` to identify which component this `<type>` is related to; Example `<scope>` values:
  - init
  - runner
  - watcher
  - config
  - web-server
  - proxy
  - etc.
- The `<scope>` can also be empty (e.g. if the change is a global or difficult to assign to a single component), in which case the parentheses are omitted.

### Message Body
- Includes **motivation** for the change and contrasts with previous behavior.
- Use the body to explain **whats** and **whys** vs. *hows*.
- Wrap each line of the body at **72** characters.

### Message Footer
- Reference issues this commit is related to with the status of that Issue; Ex. `Issue #27`, `Ref T27` or `Ref T27, T56` or `Fixes T8`.
- Supported issue tracker status keywords:
  - Fixes
  - Fixed
  - Closes
  - Closed
  - Resolves
  - Resolved
  - Ref
  - Issue
  - Issues
- More info on issue tracker status keywords:
  - [GitHub Issues](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/)
  - [GitLab Issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/automatic_issue_closing.html)
  - [Phabricator Tasks](https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/diffusion_autoclose/)
- It's also [recommended](/../../issues/19) to use _Full URL to the Issues_, instead of just issue ID Number; Doing so will ease browsing issues from terminal.
- In the case of multiple issues separate them with commas, Ex. `Closes #27, #56`.

### Notes
- Use valid [MarkDown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) format in the `<body>`.
- All **WIP**(Work In Progress) commits **SHOULD** have the :construction: Emoji.
- All **WIP** commits **SHOULD** be avoided!.
- Referencing Issues by using special keywords like `Fixes` or `Resolves` will mark them as closed automatically! For more  information about automatic issue closing using ketwords see their documentation(linked above).
- There is **NO** new-line after the `<footer>`.
- Every emoji text(`:emoji:`) is counted as one character!.
- See [ToDo Grammar StyleGuide](https://github.com/slashsbin/styleguide-todo-grammar) for more Information on `@XXX` Comment Tags.
